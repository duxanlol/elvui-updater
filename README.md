# ElvUI Updater __(Wrath Classic)__
_A small script to automate a one-minute-task that bugged me so I wasted an hour writing it._

The scripts automatically backs up your old ElvUI, downloads a new version of __WotLK Classic ElvUI__, and unzips it to the addons directory.


## How-to:
Probably the only line you need to edit to get this to work is:
```
ADDONS_FOLDER = 'C:\Games\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns'
```
If you're missing any requirements do:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
